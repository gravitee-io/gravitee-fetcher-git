== Documentation

This plugin allow Gravitee.io to fetch content from a git repository.
It's primarily used to fetch documentation.

**Authentications is currently not supported**.

== Cautions
This plugin is based on https://eclipse.org/jgit/[JGit].
The current version of JGit (4.4.0.201606070830-r) doesn't support shallow clones (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=475615).
This means that the entire repository is cloned in a temporary folder.

This could take some times and spaces on your device.
